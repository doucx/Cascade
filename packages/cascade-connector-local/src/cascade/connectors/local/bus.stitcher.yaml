"LocalBusConnector": |-
  A robust, in-memory implementation of the Connector protocol.
  Acts as a local MQTT broker, supporting:
  - Shared state across instances (simulating a network broker)
  - Retained messages
  - Topic wildcards (+ and #)
"LocalBusConnector._get_lock": |-
  Ensures the lock is bound to the current running event loop.
  This is critical for pytest where each test has its own loop.
"LocalBusConnector._listener_loop": |-
  Consumes messages from the subscription queue and invokes callback.
"LocalBusConnector._reset_broker_state": |-
  Helper for tests to clear the 'broker'.
"LocalBusConnector._topic_matches": |-
  Checks if a concrete topic matches a subscription pattern (supporting + and #).
"_LocalSubscriptionHandle": |-
  Implementation of the subscription handle for the LocalBusConnector.
