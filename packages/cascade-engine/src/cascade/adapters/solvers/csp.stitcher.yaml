"CSPSolver": |-
  A solver that uses Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques to produce
  a resource-aware execution plan.

  It employs Iterative Deepening Search to find the schedule with the minimum
  number of stages (Makespan) that satisfies all dependency and resource constraints.

  Args:
      system_resources: A dictionary defining the total available capacity
                        for each resource (e.g., {"gpu": 2, "memory_gb": 32}).
