"_publish_limit": |-
  Core logic for publishing concurrency or rate limit constraints.
"_publish_pause": |-
  Core logic for publishing a pause constraint.
"_publish_resume": |-
  Core logic for publishing a resume (clear constraint) command.
"pause": |-
  Publish a 'pause' constraint to the control plane.
  This will cause running Cascade engines to stop scheduling new tasks that
  match the specified scope until a 'resume' command is sent.
"resume": |-
  Publish a 'resume' command to the control plane.
  This clears any 'pause' constraint for the specified scope, allowing
  tasks to be scheduled again.
"set_limit": |-
  Publish a 'concurrency' or 'rate_limit' constraint to the control plane.
  You must provide either --concurrency or --rate (or both).
