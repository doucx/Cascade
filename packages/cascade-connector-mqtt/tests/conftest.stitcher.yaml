"mock_aiomqtt_module": |-
  Creates a completely isolated, fake 'aiomqtt' module and injects it into
  sys.modules.

  CRITICAL: This fixture also aggressively removes 'cascade.connectors.mqtt'
  from sys.modules to force a reload. This guarantees that the business logic
  imports our FAKE aiomqtt, even if the REAL one was loaded by a previous test.
