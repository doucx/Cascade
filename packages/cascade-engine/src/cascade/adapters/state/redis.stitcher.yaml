"RedisStateBackend": |-
  A StateBackend implementation that persists results to Redis.
"RedisStateBackend.clear": |-
  Clears the state for the current run.
  For Redis, since TCO reuses the same run_id and overwrites keys,
  explicit clearing might be expensive (SCAN+DEL).
  For now, we treat this as a no-op to satisfy the protocol,
  relying on key overwrite semantics.
