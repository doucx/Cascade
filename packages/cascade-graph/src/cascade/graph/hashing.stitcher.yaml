"BlueprintHasher": |-
  Computes a hash for a Graph's topology, ignoring literal input values.
  This hash is used to cache compiled execution plans.
"BlueprintHasher._get_merkle_hash": |-
  Computes a stable hash from a list of string components.
"BlueprintHasher._get_node_components": |-
  Gets the hash components for a single node, normalizing literals.
"BlueprintHasher.compute_hash": |-
  Computes the blueprint hash for the entire graph.
"HashingService": |-
  Service responsible for computing a stable Merkle hash for a node instance.
  This is the `Instance Hash`, which uniquely identifies a specific, fully-parameterized
  node instance. It is used for results caching and node de-duplication within a graph.
"HashingService._build_hash_components": |-
  Recursively builds hash components, always including literal values.
"HashingService._get_merkle_hash": |-
  Computes a stable hash from a list of string components.
"HashingService.compute_structural_hash": |-
  Computes the Structural Hash (Instance Hash) for a given result object.
