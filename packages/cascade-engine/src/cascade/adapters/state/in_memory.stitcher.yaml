"InMemoryStateBackend": |-
  An in-memory implementation of the StateBackend protocol using Python dictionaries.
  This is the default backend for local, single-process runs.

  ARCHITECTURAL NOTE on ASYNC IMPLEMENTATION:
  This class adheres to the `async def` contract of the StateBackend protocol,
  but it does NOT use `asyncio.to_thread`. This is an intentional performance
  optimization.

  Dictionary operations are synchronous but are pure-CPU and extremely fast
  (nanosecond-scale). They do not perform blocking I/O. Using `to_thread`
  would introduce significant overhead (context switching, thread pool management)
  for a non-existent problem, crippling performance in high-throughput scenarios
  like TCO fast paths.

  This implementation provides a compliant async interface with minimal overhead,
  making it suitable for its primary role as a high-performance, single-process backend.
"InMemoryStateBackend.clear": |-
  Clears all results and skip reasons. Used between TCO iterations.
