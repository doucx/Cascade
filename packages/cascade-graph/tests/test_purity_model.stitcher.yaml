"test_impure_tasks_have_unique_identities": |-
  Verifies that default tasks (Impure) have unique structural identities.

  Scenario:
  The same task is called twice, even with identical arguments.

  Expected Behavior (CP-006):
  The system should treat them as two separate nodes in the graph, each
  with a different structural_id.

  Previous Behavior (Fixed):
  The system would merge them into a single node via hash-consing.
"test_pure_tasks_are_deduplicated": |-
  Verifies that pure tasks are correctly deduplicated.
