"test_explicit_jump_loop": |-
  Tests the core explicit state transition mechanism.
  - A task returns a `cs.Jump` signal.
  - `cs.bind` statically connects the task to a `cs.select_jump` chooser.
  - The engine interprets the jump and reschedules the next task with new data,
    bypassing graph rebuilding.
