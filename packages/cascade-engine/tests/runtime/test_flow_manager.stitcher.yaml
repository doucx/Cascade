"create_mock_lazy_result": |-
  Creates a mock LazyResult whose UUID matches the node ID for mapping.
"create_mock_node": |-
  Creates a mock Node with structural_id == name.
"test_flow_manager_pruning_logic": |-
  Test that FlowManager correctly prunes downstream nodes recursively.

  Graph Topology:
  S (Selector) -> chooses "a" or "b"

  Routes:
  - "a": A
  - "b": B -> B_UP (B depends on B_UP)

  Consumer C depends on Router(S)

  If S chooses "a":
  1. Route "b" (Node B) is not selected.
  2. B should be pruned.
  3. B_UP (only used by B) should be recursively pruned.
