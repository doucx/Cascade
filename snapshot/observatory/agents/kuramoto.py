"""
Implementation of a Firefly agent based on the Kuramoto model
of coupled oscillators, using pure Cascade primitives.

REVISION 6: Bypassed cs.inject by passing the connector manually.
This is a workaround for a suspected bug in resource injection within
deeply recursive, cross-engine workflows.
