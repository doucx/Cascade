"test_csp_solver_init": |-
  Test that CSPSolver can be initialized with resources.
"test_csp_solver_missing_dependency": |-
  Test that meaningful error is raised if dependency is missing.
"test_csp_solver_parallel_when_resources_sufficient": |-
  Scenario: System has 10 CPU.
  Task A needs 4 CPU.
  Task B needs 4 CPU.
  No dependencies.

  Expected: Both run in Stage 0 (Parallel).
"test_csp_solver_serial_when_resources_insufficient": |-
  Scenario: System has 6 CPU.
  Task A needs 4 CPU.
  Task B needs 4 CPU.
  No dependencies.

  Expected: Run in separate stages (Serial) to respect limit.
  Plan should be 3 stages: [A], [B], [Gather] OR [B], [A], [Gather].
