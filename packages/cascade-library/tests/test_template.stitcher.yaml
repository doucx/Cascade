"test_template_missing_dependency_install": |-
  This test is more conceptual and would require manipulating sys.modules
  to simulate jinja2 not being installed. It's complex to set up reliably.
  The runtime check in the provider is sufficient for now.
  We can assume the ImportError is raised correctly if jinja2 is absent.
"test_template_with_lazy_result": |-
  Tests that the template correctly depends on an upstream task.
"test_template_with_literals": |-
  Tests basic rendering with static values.
