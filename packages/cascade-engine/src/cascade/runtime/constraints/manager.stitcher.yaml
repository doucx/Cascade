  handlers for evaluation.
"ConstraintManager._remove_constraint_by_id": |-
  Helper to remove a constraint and notify handler.

"ConstraintManager.remove_constraints_by_scope": |-
  Removes all constraints that match the given scope.
"ConstraintManager.request_wakeup": |-
  Requests the engine to wake up after a specified delay (in seconds).

"ConstraintManager.update_constraint": |-
  Adds a new constraint or updates an existing one.
  Ensures strict 'Last-Write-Wins' behavior by removing any existing
